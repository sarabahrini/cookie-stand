        <div>So many salmon, so little time! There are quite a few different types of salmon and knowing the differences between the types can make grocery shopping much easier. First, you have to decide between wild-caught salmon and farm-raised salmon which is not only a decision based on taste preference but also on personal ethics. Wild salmon is caught in the Pacific ocean and because this type of salmon is caught in its natural habitat, it tends to be richer in both color and taste than its counterpart. Farm-raised salmon, also called Atlantic salmon, has a higher fat content because the fish are raised on a rich oil and grain diet. The higher fat content makes it harder to overcook—a tempting choice if you’re inexperienced in the kitchen. Wild-caught salmon is leaner and should be cooked medium rare; overcooking it will lead to very dry, almost inedible fish.</div>
